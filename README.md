## Getting Started

AI Adventure is a “Choose Your Own Adventure” game in which users can create characters, choose a storyline, and follow prompts to continue down a story path. Stories are newly generated by utilizing OpenAI API with Davinci engine. Using this API allows the user a multitude of different storylines for continuous engagement.

See the [live demo here](https://adventure-ai-app.herokuapp.com/)

To get started, users sign up for an account (or sign in with Google)
