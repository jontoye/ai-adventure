This app was created in ten days as the final project for [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s Software Engineering Immersive. Supporting development has continued thereafter.

## Getting Started

AI Adventure is a “Choose Your Own Adventure” game in which users can create characters, choose a storyline, and follow prompts to continue down a story path. Stories are newly generated by utilizing OpenAI API with Davinci engine. Using this API allows the user a multitude of different storylines for continuous engagement.

## Creating a Character

To create a character, go to 'Create Character' and fill in the required form, or let the Randomize Character button do it for you! You will then need to come up with a backstory for your character, or you can ask the AI to write one for you.

## Creating an Adventure

To create an Adventure, go to 'Create Adventure', or click "Start Adventure" from the character's page and fill in the required form. Upon beggining the adventurer the AI will spend a little bit of time thinking up a great story for you to play through!

## Adventure Gameplay

Once you start an adventure, or continue a saved adventure, you will begin your adventure! AI Adventure is a text-based choose-your-own adventure game, so gameplay consists of reading through a short story and selecting one of the options provided to you by the AI. Once you select an option the AI will begin thinking about where to take your story next!
