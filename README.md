## Getting Started

AI Adventure is a “Choose Your Own Adventure” game in which users can create characters, choose a storyline, and follow prompts to continue down a story path. Stories are newly generated by utilizing OpenAI API with Davinci engine. Using this API allows the user a multitude of different storylines for continuous engagement.

See the [live demo here](https://adventure-ai-app.herokuapp.com/)

To get started, users sign up for an account (or sign in with Google)

## Creating an Event

To create an event, go to the 'Add Event' page and fill out the form provided. Custom events can be color coded to help categorize events on the grid view page. You may also attach a photo to the event to make it stand out.

## Viewing Your Events

Calender.io provides three main ways to view your events from your homepage: Grid View, Pin View, and List View. You can also view a list of all the events you have created and events you are attending from your profile page.<br>
Clicking on an event brings up that event's detail page. Each event may contain multiple 'tags' representing the categories this event falls under. Clicking on one of these tags will redirect you to the search page where all events containing that same tag will be displayed.

## Searching for Events

Looking for something to do? Calender.io brings in real data from Eventbrite that you can search through using keywords and locations. Add and remove events as needed using the + and - buttons on the event detail page.
